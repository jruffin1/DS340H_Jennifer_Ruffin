# DS340H_Jennifer_Ruffin
This is the repository for my 2025 Capstone Final Project. The repository contains a ReadMe file, R/Python Scripts used for data visualizations and analysis, as well as the cleaned datasets used

#### Sample Data
Data from Blue Bike of months May 2024 to August 2024

#### CapstoneFinal.csv Dataset
This is the final, cleaned data set that I used to build my models and complete visualizations with. The data is subsetted by the top 5 most frequently used start stations. 

#### cleaning part1.r File
This is the initial data cleaning process of my data set. It generated the BlueBike_csv dataset that was too big to place in this repository. 

#### Model building.ipynb
This notebook contains the model building process for my predictions.
